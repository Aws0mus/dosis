1. Description of Dosis
=======================

  Dosis is a Denial of Service Test suite.

  If you have any idea or suggestion, or if you think you have found a bug, you
  can contact me at
  
    Gerardo García Peña <gerardo@kung-foo.net>


2. Quick install
================

  You will need root privileges unless you install this software in your home
  (see --prefix option in 'configure --help').

  Go to a temporary directory (in this example we will use /var/tmp) and
  uncompress Dosis distribution there.

    $ cd /var/tmp/
    $ zcat <your dosis-1.0.0.tar.gz dist file> | tar xvf -
    $ cd dosis-1.0.0

  Configure Dosis with 'configure':

    $ ./configure

  If the default configuration is not useful for you, you can tweak it. Try
  'configure --help' to get a list of possible configuration and installation
  options. The default configuration will install all Dosis files in
  '/usr/local' directory.

  Once configured, build the package:

    $ make

  If all have gone ok you can install now Dosis executing the following line
  after getting root privileges:

    $ su
    Password: 
    # make install


3. Using Dosis
==============

  Dosis is based on its own script language. It is a very simple language,
  where every instruction have a timestamp which decides when it will be
  scheduled. This is an example script:

    lineNo | example code
   --------+--------------------------------------------------------------
      01   | # program example
      02   |  1.00 SHOST="192.168.1.1"
      03   | +0.50 THOST="192.168.1.2"
      04   |       TPORT="80"
      05   |
      06   | # attack is started here
      07   |  2.00 ON 1 UDP SRC $SHOST DST $THOST $TPORT PERIODIC [ 1.0 ]
      08   | +5.00 OFF *

  Comments (lines started by a hash char '#') and void lines are ignored.

  Each line, except void and comment lines, begins with an optional absolute or
  relative timestamp.

  You can get help about how to invoke Dosis with option '-h' or '--help'.
