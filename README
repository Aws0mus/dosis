1. Description of Dosis
=======================

  Dosis is a Denial of Service Test suite.

  If you have any idea or suggestion, or if you think you have found a bug, you
  can contact me at
  
    Gerardo García Peña <gerardo@kung-foo.dhs.org>


2. Quick install
================

  You will need root privileges unless you install this software in your home
  (see --prefix option in 'configure --help').

  Go to a temporary directory (in this example we will use /var/tmp) and
  uncompress Dosis distribution there.

    $ cd /var/tmp/
    $ zcat <your dosis-1.0.0.tar.gz dist file> | tar xvf -
    $ cd dosis-1.0.0

  Configure Dosis with 'configure':

    $ ./configure

  If the default configuration is not useful for you, you can tweak it. Try
  'configure --help' to get a list of possible configuration and installation
  options. The default configuration will install all Dosis files in
  '/usr/local' directory.

  Once configured, build the package:

    $ make

  If all have gone ok you can install now Dosis executing the following line
  after getting root privileges:

    $ su
    Password: 
    # make install


3. Using Dosis
==============

  You can get help on using Dosis with option '-h' or '--help'.


4. License of Dosis
===================

  All Dosis files are governed by the GPL license (GNU General Public License,
